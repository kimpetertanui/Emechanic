# Emechanic

In this project a system to link Drivers with the Mechanics has been developed. 
The system can handle as may users as possible. For mechanics, they can upload their service information as one of the objectives and the system is able to capture the location based on the address of their locations. 
Drivers can view the location of the mechanics on the google map and get the get the nearest mechanic and after getting satisfied they can directly contact the mechanic whereby they pay some small fee. 
In either of the cases the mechanic can view the pickup locations for the driver.
